# Screenshots Instructions

To complete the README, you need to take two screenshots:

## 1. Main Interface Screenshot (`main-interface.png`)
- Open the app at http://localhost:5174/
- Draw something colorful on the 32x32 canvas
- Type a custom title in the text box
- Take a screenshot of the entire interface showing:
  - The title "32x32 Pixel Canvas"
  - The text input with your custom title
  - The clear button
  - The color palette with one color selected
  - The canvas with your pixel art
- Save as `main-interface.png`

## 2. Tab Icon Screenshot (`tab-icon.png`)
- With your pixel art drawn and title set
- Take a screenshot of just the browser tab area showing:
  - Your custom title in the tab
  - Your pixel art as the favicon/tab icon
- Crop to show just the tab with the custom icon
- Save as `tab-icon.png`

## Tips
- Use a colorful drawing so the favicon is clearly visible
- Make sure the tab title is descriptive
- The favicon should match exactly what you drew on the canvas
- Both images should be PNG format for best quality

Once you have both screenshots, the README will be complete!
